# fullstack-ts-react-java

Description:
At home: Please create a simple application with a React & TypeScript front end and a Java back end. The front end should make a call to the back end, receive a response, and present it in the front end. Consider input sanitisation. The back end should interact with a SQL database. Create a local Git repository for this project. We do not expect perfection but would like to see confidence and good practices. Please share the code with us only via a GitHub link.

During our interview: You will walk us through the code, and we will ask you follow-up questions, ask you to modify the code or add a simple feature (60 minutes). Please make sure you can share your screen with where we can see the code in your IDE and the app running. We will also discuss your career so far and ask a couple of competency questions (30 minutes).
