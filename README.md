# ðŸ“¬ Message App â€“ Fullstack Application

This project was created as part of a **recruitment task**.

It consists of a **Java Spring Boot** backend and a **React + TypeScript** frontend. The goal was to implement a simple fullstack application where the frontend communicates with the backend, which in turn interacts with a SQL database.

Both parts of the project are included as Git submodules:

- [`backend`](./backend) â€“ Java, Spring Boot, SQL
- [`frontend`](./frontend) â€“ React, TypeScript

## ðŸ§© Tech Stack

### Backend
- Java 21
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web, Spring Data JPA
- SQL Database H2
- Maven

### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Vite

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Each submodule (`backend` and `frontend`) contains its own `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to run it locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for frontend)
- Java 21+ and Maven (for backend)
- Git


### Backend (Java + Spring Boot)

```bash
cd backend
# Follow instructions in backend/README.md or run:
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend should start on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

```bash
cd frontend
# Follow instructions in frontend/README.md or run:
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend should be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
